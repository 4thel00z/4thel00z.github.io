While it looked promising at first, it was an abandonware.<br>So I thought it might be a good idea to build something on top of it called <a href=https://github.com/4thel00z/templatectl>templatectl</a>.<p>Current enhancements include a self upgrade mechanism and some filters for ease of use.<br>Also I have created two new templates which play well with my other projects:<ul><li><a href=https://github.com/4thel00z/blog-post-template>blog-post-template</a> - This is for generating posts for this blogging plattform<li><a href=https://github.com/4thel00z/service-templated-module>service_templated module</a> - This is for generating modules for <a href=https://github.com/4thel00z/service_templated>service_templated</a></ul><p>If you like the idea give it a spin, peace.
