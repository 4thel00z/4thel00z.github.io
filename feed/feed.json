While it looked promising at first, it was an abandonware.<br>\nSo I thought it might be a good idea to build something on top of it called <a href=\"https://github.com/4thel00z/templatectl\">templatectl</a>.</p>\n<p>Current enhancements include a self upgrade mechanism and some filters for ease of use.<br>\nAlso I have created two new templates which play well with my other projects:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/4thel00z/blog-post-template\">blog-post-template</a> - This is for generating posts for this blogging plattform</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/4thel00z/service-templated-module\">service_templated module</a> - This is for generating modules for <a href=\"https://github.com/4thel00z/service_templated\">service_templated</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you like the idea give it a spin, peace.</p>\n",
